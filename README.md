# tokenfolio | crypto tracker

## About

tokenfolio fetches live crypto data from **CoinCap API** and exchange rates from **ExchangeRate API** (USD-based). It also remembers your recent activity, thanks to browser caching â€” with a TTL (time to live) that you can adjust in the config file.

### Notes

-   Make sure you have valid API keys â€” the app wonâ€™t work without them.
-   You can tweak the cache TTL in the `api.config.ts` file if you want to adjust how long recent activity is saved.
